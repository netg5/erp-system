### Plan

I will setup authentication with reactjs and laravel. Enabling cors for laravel.

### Job Done

1. Enabling cors for laravel
#### 1. Enabling cors for laravel
If we dont enable the cors in laravel backend, there is no way to consume data from the frontend api and it will always show No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. We should mitigate that problem with code snippet which implement cors middleware in this gist. https://gist.github.com/technoknol/1a35ca4b150215f491d5c807940bd4ef.
