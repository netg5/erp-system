There is some error in my redux workflow. The error was custom render function at src/route.js. I suppose to check api authentication every time route changed in react side. Unfortunately there is an error which continously checking without any stopping at the function which will cuased maximum call stack exception. So reconfigure redux-saga workflow according to the real-world example at redux-sagas-example.
